\description{
Data includes lake name, dates of freeze-up and thaw, and duration of ice cover of lakes in the Madison, WI area. Ice cover duration is the number of days that a lake is frozen, excluding periods where the lake thaws before refreezing again. Lakes Monona and Wingra are considered to be frozen if they are completely ice covered,
while Lake Mendota is considered to be frozen if there is ice from Picnic Point to Maple Bluff and more than 50\% of the lake is covered by ice.
