# lterdatasampler <a href='https://lter.github.io/lterdatasampler/'><img src="man/figures/logo.png" id="home_logo" align="right" height="180"/></a>

The mission of the [Long Term Ecological Research program (LTER)
Network](https://lternet.edu/) is to “*provide the scientific community,
policy makers, and society with the knowledge and predictive
understanding necessary to conserve, protect, and manage the nation’s
ecosystems, their biodiversity, and the services they provide.*” A
specific goal of the LTER is [education and
training](https://lternet.edu/education-and-training/) - “*to promote
training, teaching, and learning about long-term ecological research and
the Earth’s ecosystems, and to educate a new generation of scientists.*”

The goal of this package is to provide a sampler to gather feedback from
the community of what will be a larger package containing 28 datasets -
one from each of the existing [US LTER
sites](https://lternet.edu/site/). Those datasets are subsets of the
original data and have been updated - sometimes substantially - from the
raw data. They are aimed to be useful for teaching and training in
environmental data science. **This content is thus not suitable for
research and should only be used for teaching purposes**.

We encourage you to explore existing LTER [teaching and training
initiatives](https://lternet.edu/education-and-training/), and the
**many** other available LTER datasets which can be accessed via the
[Environmental Data
Initiative](https://edirepository.org/). Please contact
cited researchers directly to discuss using data for research purposes
or in publication.

## Installation

You can install the CRAN version of `lterdatasampler` with:

``` r

remotes::install_github("lter/lterdatasampler")
```

## The dataset samples

Dataset samples currently included in the package are summarized below;

## Which data sample should I use?

These data samples are selected because they have features we feel are
commonly useful in introductory environmental data science and
statistics courses.

In the table below, we list some introductory methods / skills, then
share which data samples in this package we think are well-suited to use
when teaching or learning them! It is not comprehensive - there are
*many* different analyses & skills that these data samples would
facilitate. Here we highlight a few that we think would be commonly
useful
